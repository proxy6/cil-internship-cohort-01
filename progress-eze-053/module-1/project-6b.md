## Article on UI/UX Fundamentals

### UI
User Interface or UI is the visual representation of a digital product or any kind of product. UI is the link between the user and the functionality of a product. It is the use of grid, typography, colors, layout and animations to create products that are easy to use and pleasing to the users’ eyes.

A UI designer is responsible for the look and feel of the product. UI design involves anticipating the user’s preferences and creating an interface that both understands and fulfills them. Precision, attention to detail and careful planning are all necessary. Readability, useful and aesthetically pleasing result is the climax of a successful UI design. A successful user interface should be intuitive, efficient and user-friendly.

#### Five Tips that Improve User Interface Design
-   ###### Know Your Users.
Acquiring a good knowledge and understanding about your users and their needs can help you better design what will meet those needs. 
-   ###### Keep It Simple.
Great user interfaces are almost imperceptible. They are not extravagant, overly embellished, or encumbered with frills. They only include the most important information, which is presented in a logical and simple manner. 
-   ###### Be Consistent.
Since people establish habits rapidly, it is critical to maintain consistency throughout the product. Users may locate and stay in their comfort zone with consistent interfaces throughout a session. Consistency helps users to focus on the content rather than how to locate the content
-   ###### Hierarchy.
Draw attention to the most crucial interface elements so that users can find and concentrate on them. There are varieties of design approaches you can take to accomplish this. Making a key button larger or brightly colored to make it stand out is a basic example.
-   ###### Understand the Rules of Perception.
Rules of perception are perceptive mechanisms our mind uses to connect and organize partial information into a coherent whole. The human brain tries to connect the dots. We must be able to back up our design decisions with evidence. Knowing the rules of perception can make it much easier to justify our decisions and avoid numerous typical blunders. By putting that knowledge to use, we can improve and simplify our designs. 


### UX 
User Experience or UX is how a person, the user feels about interacting with or experiencing the product. It is the design of experiences for users. An experience is any interaction someone can have with a product The goal of UX is to allow the largest possible group of users the ability to understand and use a product. UX design is a user centered design process that places the need of users at the fore front of creation. UX design is all about helping people and solving problems, it isn’t just limited to the digital space. Anything that can be experienced can be designed.
As a UX designer, you should consider these three things:
-   ##### The WHY of product use.
The WHY involves the users’ motivations for adopting a product, whether they relate to a task they wish to perform with it or to values and views that users associate with the ownership and use of the product.
-   ##### The WHAT of product use.
The WHAT addresses the things people can do with a product — its functionality.
-   ##### The HOW of product use.
The HOW relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way.
UX designers start with the Why before determining the What and then, finally, the How in order to create products that users can form meaningful experiences with. Predicting user roadblocks and potential design mishaps is what good User Experience design is all about.
